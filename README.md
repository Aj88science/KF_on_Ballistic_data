The recursive Kalman filter is implemented on  the  generated ballistic data.

The Kalman filter is a recursive, optimal, and state-based estimator used in various fields, including control systems, signal processing, and estimation problems. It is specifically designed to estimate the state of a dynamic system in the presence of uncertain or noisy measurements.

The Kalman filter is a state-space estimator, meaning it estimates the current state of a system based on its previous state and the available measurements. It models the system as a set of linear equations and assumes that the system evolves over time according to linear dynamics. The filter uses a probabilistic framework that incorporates both the system dynamics and measurement uncertainties to provide an optimal estimate of the true system state.

The Kalman filter operates in two steps: the prediction step and the update step.

1. Prediction Step: In this step, the Kalman filter predicts the current state of the system based on the previous state estimate and the system dynamics model. It utilizes a prediction equation that incorporates the system's dynamics and any control inputs. The prediction step provides an estimate of the system state and an associated uncertainty.

2. Update Step: In this step, the Kalman filter updates the predicted state estimate using the available measurements. It compares the predicted state with the actual measurements and computes a correction based on the measurement error and the uncertainty in the predicted state estimate. The update step uses a weighted combination of the prediction and the measurement to obtain an improved estimate of the system state.

The Kalman filter optimally fuses the information from the system dynamics and the measurements to provide the best estimate of the true system state. It dynamically adjusts its estimates based on the reliability and accuracy of the measurements and the consistency of the system dynamics model.

The Kalman filter is widely used in applications such as navigation, tracking, robotics, and control systems. It is especially effective in situations where there is uncertainty, noise, or incomplete information about the system's state. By continuously updating the state estimate based on measurements, the Kalman filter enables accurate tracking and estimation of dynamic systems, even in the presence of noise and disturbances.
